In 1960, while looking to secure broadcasting rights to a new California expansion team, he was instead persuaded to become the team’s owner—and the Los Angeles Angels were born. After he died, the Angels retired the number 26 in his honor, reflectingm his position as the unofficial 26th member of the team’s 25-member roster.
